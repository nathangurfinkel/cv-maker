# CV Builder Backend Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The original `main.py` file (751 lines) has been refactored according to SOLID principles and small project best practices into a well-structured, modular application.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Before**: One massive file handling all concerns
- **After**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility:
  - `config.py`: Configuration management
  - `models/`: Data models and validation
  - `services/`: Business logic
  - `routes/`: API endpoints
  - `utils/`: Helper functions

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Services are designed to be extended without modification
- New templates can be added without changing existing code
- New evaluation metrics can be added to the evaluation service

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Service interfaces are consistent and interchangeable
- All services follow the same initialization pattern

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Services are focused on specific domains
- No service depends on methods it doesn't use

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions (service interfaces)
- Configuration is injected rather than hardcoded

## New Project Structure

```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Configuration is centralized in `config.py`
- Business logic is isolated in service classes
- API routes are separated by domain
- Models are organized by purpose

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Each file has a clear, single purpose
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 3. **Testability**
- Services can be unit tested independently
- Dependencies can be easily mocked
- Clear interfaces make testing straightforward

### 4. **Scalability**
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- Services can be extended or replaced
- New routes can be added without affecting existing ones

### 5. **Configuration Management**
- All environment variables and settings in one place
- Easy to modify for different environments
- Type-safe configuration with Pydantic

## Service Architecture

### AIService
- Handles all OpenAI API interactions
- Methods for CV generation, evaluation, transcription, and image analysis
- Centralized error handling for AI operations

### VectorstoreService
- Manages document storage and retrieval
- Supports both Pinecone and ChromaDB
- Handles document chunking and indexing

### EvaluationService
- Manages CV evaluation using RAGAS and committee evaluation
- Parallel processing for multiple evaluation methods
- Handles evaluation result aggregation

### PDFService
- Handles PDF generation using WeasyPrint and Jinja2
- Template management and validation
- PDF response formatting

## API Endpoints (Refactored)

The API endpoints have been reorganized with clear prefixes:

- `GET /` - Health check
- `POST /cv/tailor` - Tailor CV from text
- `POST /cv/tailor-from-file` - Tailor CV from uploaded file
- `POST /evaluation/cv` - Perform committee evaluation
- `POST /pdf/generate` - Generate PDF from CV data
- `GET /pdf/templates` - Get available PDF templates
- `POST /utility/transcribe-audio` - Transcribe audio to text
- `POST /utility/analyze-jd-image` - Extract job description from image

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Code Quality**: Much easier to read, understand, and maintain
2. **Development Speed**: Faster to implement new features
3. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate and fix issues
4. **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
6. **Documentation**: Clear structure makes the code self-documenting

## Migration Guide

To use the refactored application:

1. **For Development**: Use `python main_new.py` or `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. **For Production**: Use `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
3. **For Testing**: Import from `app` package: `from app import app`

The original `main.py` is kept for reference but should not be used for new development.

## Testing

The refactored application has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- âœ… All modules import successfully
- âœ… PDF generation works with both templates
- âœ… All services initialize properly
- âœ… API endpoints are properly configured
- âœ… AI service functionality restored
- âœ… Application can be imported and run without errors
